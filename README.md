# Wavelet decomposition method (WDM)

This repository inculdes code to decompose the meridional energy transport into contributions by
different length scales. The method is based on a Haar wavelet series. 
The implementation of the decomposition method is hard-coded to use the Haar wavelet. In the future a version
where an arbitrary discrete wavelet may be applied. 

This method is applied in Heiskanen et al. 2020 (in review).
